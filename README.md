## 👤 About Me  
👋 Hey! I’m an amateur developer who enjoys experimenting with code and figuring things out as I go.  
🔍 I’m not fully sure what direction I want to take yet — right now I’m just exploring different languages and tools.  
🎯 My main goal is to learn, build cool things, and improve a little bit every day.
