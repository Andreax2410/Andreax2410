  ##About Me
  👋 Hey! I’m an amateur developer who enjoys experimenting with code and figuring things out as I go.  
  🔍 I’m not fully sure what direction I want to take yet — right now I’m just exploring different languages and tools.  
  🎯 My main goal is to learn, build cool things, and improve a little bit every day.
